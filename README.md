description: Create reusable view components for the Masonite Framework
---

# MV-Components

A MV-Component is a powerful way to write reusable components for your Masonite applications. It provides code reusability and also testability in ways native views just does not allow. A MV-Component is typically comprised of a view file and a python class file.&#x20;

### Why use MV-Components

#### Reusability

The same MV-Component can be used in various parts of an application without needing to rewrite the same code.&#x20;

#### Single Responsibility

Allows complex logic to be stored along with the component that it belongs to instead of scattered across your codebase.

#### Readability

Makes it easier to reason about the behavior in your templates.&#x20;



### Inspirations

This project is inspired by several projects&#x20;

* ViewComponent (Ruby on Rails)
* Blade Components (Laravel)
