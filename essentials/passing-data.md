# Passing Data

**Passing data to components**

You can pass data to Masonite View Components using html attributes. All primitive datatypes are supported as well as custom objects.

****

**Passing values as strings**

```
<x-Button data="{{ value }}"/>
```

****

**Passing objects**

```
<x-Button data={{ value }}/>
```

Notice that passing objects we remove the quotes around our variable.&#x20;
